The figure on the upper right is an illustration of a scanning monochromator. Light enters through an entrance slit and a collimating mirror focuses it on a diffraction grating that spreads the light out in space. A focusing mirror directs the light to an exit slit that passes it to the detector. Rotating the diffraction grating allows different wavelengths of light to sequentially exit the monochromator; this what it means to scan a monochromator. 

When we use a scanning monochromator to record an absorbance spectrum, the quality of the result is affected by several experimental factors, three of which we explore in this unit: slit width, response time, and scan rate

The **slit width** determines the range of wavelengths, $\Delta \lambda$, in nanometers, that exit the monochromator. If the monochromator is set to a wavelength of 250 nm and the exit and the entrance slits have widths of 1.0 nm, then the exit slit passes light with wavelengths between 249 nm and 251 nm with the greatest intensity at 250 nm and with intensity approaching zero at 249 nm and 251 nm. A smaller slit width also reduces the amount of light that passes through the monochomator.

*Note. A 1.0 nm slit width does not mean the physical slit is 1.0 nm wide. A slit consists of two metal plates aligned to form a rectangular opening with a width on the scale of millimeters (see photo on right). The diffraction grating spreads out the light on the order of 0.1--10 nm per mm; the product of this value and the width of the slit in mm gives the slit width in nm.*

The **response time** is a measure of how long it takes the spectrometer to respond to a change in absorbance. A smaller response time means a faster response. 

*Note. There is no single way to report response times. For the instrument in this unit, the response time is the time it takes to reach 98% of its expected value.* 

The **scan rate** is a measure of how quickly the diffraction grating rotates and, therefore, the rate at which light passes over the exit slit in nanometers per minute.
