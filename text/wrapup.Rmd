#### Notes on the Spectra in this Unit

The 97 spectra in this unit---the 96 possible combinations of slit widths, response times, and scan rates plus the standard spectrum---were recorded in the early 1990s on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda B4 spectrometer, a scanning double-beam instrument acquired in 1987. This particular instrument did not save data in a permanent electronic form; instead, spectra were archived as printouts. For this project, each individual spectrum was scanned and saved as a pdf file. The image in the pdf file was then cropped in Apple Preview and exported as a png image. Finally, each png image file was digitized using [WebPlotDigitizer (Version 4.5)](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer), written by Ankit Rohatgi, and saved as a spreadsheet in csv format.

#### Another Look at an Instrument's Response Time

Earlier we described the response time as a measure of how long it takes a spectrometer to respond to a change in absorbance and that there is no one agreed upon way to report a spectrometer's response time. For the spectrometer in this module the response time is a measure of how long it takes, in seconds, to reach 98% of the expected absorbance following an instantaneous change in absorbance.

The figure on the upper right provides a more instructive way to think about response time. The *y*-axis shows a signal as recorded by an instrument and the *x*-axis shows time. The initial signal is identified as $S_0$ and it remains constant until it is pulsed to $S_1$ at time $t_0$. An ideal instrument will respond to the applied pulse by instantly changing its measurement of the signal from $S_0$ to $S_1$, as shown by the solid blue line. A real instrument, however, is not ideal and cannot respond instantly to this applied pulse. A useful analogy is a thermometer placed in a glass of ice water, which does not instantly adjust itself to read 0Â°C as each part of the thermometer immersed in the ice water must equilibrate to the water's temperature, and equilibration takes time. 

The instrument's actual response to the instantaneous change in the signal is shown by the dashed orange line. When the pulse is first applied, the difference between $S_1$ and $S_0$ is large and the rate of change is high. As the signal becomes closer to $S_1$, the rate of change deceases. The change in the signal as a function of time, $S(t)$ is given by the following equation
$$S(t) = S_1 - (S_1 - S_0) e^{-t/\tau}$$
where $\tau$ is called the instrument's time constant. When $t = \tau$, the signal has changed by a factor of $1 - \frac{1}{e} = 0.632$ or 63.2% of the difference between $S_0$ and $S_1$; this is shown by the black dot in the figure on the upper right. Defining the response time as that needed to achieve 98% of the difference between $S_0$ and $S_1$ is equivalent to $1- e^{t/\tau} = 0.98$, or $t/\tau \approx 4$, or the equivalent of four time constants.

#### Scanning Takes Time!

Many of the UV/Vis spectrometers you will use are not scanning instruments. Instead, they take advantage of a photodiode array detector that allows for the simultaneous measurement of absorbance at, typically, 512, 1024, or 2048 individual wavelengths. Because the measurements are made at the same time, a full spectrum is obtained in less than a second. Obtaining a spectrum using a scanning monochromator, however, requires more time. To get a feel for this, watch the movie on the lower right that shows the recording of the spectrum of benzene in cyclohexane from 240 nm to 290 nm at a scan rate of 20 nm/min.
